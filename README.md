# React Test
Playing with React, [Thoughtbot-style](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/setting-up-webpack-for-react-and-hot-module-replacement).

### Getting Started

Clone the repo, and run `npm start`.

This will start a `webpack-dev-server` with flags `--hot` and `--inline`. The server will auto-reload any changes to React templates. It won't auto-reload changes to `app.js`, though.
